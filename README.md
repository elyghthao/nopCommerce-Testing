# nopCommerce-Testing (Selenium, Cucumber BDD, ExtentReports, TestNG)
This project focuses on using Java and Selenium with the Cucumber and TestNG framework. Testing is done on the nopCommerce open source website focusing on UI automation and overall functionality of the website demonstrating effective use of Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

* Features of the website are identified early and a test plan is created after analysis.
* Features are listed with specific user stories written in the Gherkin format stored in Cucumber Feature Files

* Each feature is given different scenarios with a user story testing the feature extensively
* Step definition code blocks are given to each line in the user story and stored in a feature specific java file. Code repeatability is accounted for and reused reliably.
* TestNG principles are applied ("Assert" and "Verify") and used to run each Cucumber Feature File.
* Testing results are converted and created into an html file generated by using ExtentReports to better display Pass/Fail cases.
